# Boxdrop Core Testing

### Team: EXIT_SUCCESS

The code was tested by first inputting bad level files and seeing the response of the program.
The second step is to add static/non-static shapes to a level file and see if the shape stay where they are supposed to be and move the way they are supposed to move.
The third and last step is to compile the entire program and see how well the core fits with guy and graphics.

After the debugging process and continuous work by the team.  The core appear to be fully functional, aside from the check_legal function, which is not required at this stage and can be implemented later.  

The static functions are nicely grouped into create/destroy functions for structs, printing functions for debugging, file parsing functions, feature-setting functions, destruction functions to free memory, conversion functions to set shape info, and update/destroy functions for space.  These functions fit nicely together and gives the non-static functions clear structures.  The additional two private structs also simplified the parsing to addingShape process.  A very nice touch to bridge the two steps.
