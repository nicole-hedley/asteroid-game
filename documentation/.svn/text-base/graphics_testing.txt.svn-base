## Graphics Testing ##
Brad Nelson 2/18/12

steps taken to test the graphics subsystem:
* Most importantly, the graphics works as expected with the GUI.  This is the most important indicator that things are working as they should
* tested each type of shape that can exist in the core with simple.level
* tested various colors

summary of code:
* functions that translate between cpSpace coordinates and cairo coordinates
* a function that draws the state of a cpSpace
* static functions aid the public draw function by setting the color or drawing particular shapes

suggestions for future work on graphics:
* implement a draw function that shows a shape as it is drawn 
* implement a function that draws a local frame in each shape
